# Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), 
# where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.

# It should run in O(N) time.

# Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.
# using Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle alg
